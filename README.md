 PM2(Process Management)  is a  **Daemon**  process manager that will help you manage and keep your application online, although it will provide all the logs. Getting started with PM2 is straightforward, it is offered as a simple and intuitive CLI, installable via NPM.

<h2>What is Daemon ‚ùì</h2> 
A daemon is a service process that runs in the background and supervises the system or provides functionality to other processes.

<h2>What I learnt ‚ùì</h2>
I learnt how it daemonize when we close the project and this holds all the logs, monitoring, etc. I verdict this because it is very easy and helpful which helps us to manage lavish things.
